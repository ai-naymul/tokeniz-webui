Common Tokenizers for LLMs
Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE):
Widely used in models like GPT-2 and GPT-3.
Efficient for handling subword units, allowing for a balance between vocabulary size and representation power.
Can be trained from scratch or fine-tuned using libraries like Hugging Face’s Tokenizers.
WordPiece:
Used in BERT and its variants.
Similar to BPE but incorporates a more complex algorithm to handle subwords.
Supports training on custom datasets to improve model performance on domain-specific tasks.
SentencePiece:
A versatile tokenizer that can handle various languages and scripts.
Useful for non-English languages or when dealing with unique characters.
Can be trained from scratch using custom text data.
Unigram:
Another tokenizer option available in Hugging Face’s library.
Focuses on maximizing the likelihood of the training data, which can be beneficial for certain applications.
spaCy:
A rule-based tokenizer that is highly customizable.
Useful for tasks requiring specific tokenization rules or language features.
Moses:
Primarily used in machine translation but can be adapted for other NLP tasks.
Rule-based and allows for extensive customization.
